				<h3> CHAPTER 1</h3>
				<p> There are talks that this very moon I'm in carries a lot of history. Clones gone rogue from the Empire. A team of two single handedly took down a whole Star Destroyer to avoid the mass persecution. I believe it. Part of me feels as if the Empire is hiding something. I'm not here to confirm my suspicions though. I'm here because the computers are worth something to the Scrapper Guild. And, I want in. </p>

				<h3> CHAPTER 2</h3>
				<p> My droid, R-12, picked up a scan. One of the computers are still live. After all these years, on a deserted moon, one wouldn't think that would be possible. R-12 sliced it. A weird recording of a clone repeated. Inhibitor chips. Kaminoans. The scary part is that these clones have names? Rex? Fives? Aren't they all assigned numbers? As far as I know, Kamino is lost. </p>

				<h3> CHAPTER 3</h3>
				<p> I felt a tug in me, telling me to go to Kamino. These computers aren't to be sold to the Scrapper Guild as the Empire has a hold of them. Perhaps the Empire is using them as a clean up crew to this whole conspiracy. Before I knew it, a blinker in my field of vision lit up. The Empire knows. I had R-12 wipe the computer, and we were on our way. To uncharted waters.</p>
