				<h3> CHAPTER 1</h3>
				<p> Right out of hyperspace. Left the previous star system in haste so that the Empire does not track me. What scares me, however, is that the Scrapper Guild has commissioned me to retrieve the computer from the debris of the Star Destroyer. They'll know that I have accessed the computer. And if the Guild know, the Empire knows if my suspicions are correct. Kamino. I have arrived. All I see are abandoned stations, drowned in the sea.  </p>

				<h3> CHAPTER 2</h3>
				<p> There's a station that is still up: surprisingly. This place looks like it has been shot from the sky. Meteors. Maybe a starfighter scrimmage. Something. R-12 has been slicing through the doors, which either work or don't. The Kaminoans are some tough engineers. We investigate the compound, and we stumble upon a lab. I'm afraid I do not have much time. Surely, the Empire is smart enough that I would find my way to Kamino. Not to mention, Kamino was formerly under Imperial occupation. I must act in haste.</p>

				<h3> CHAPTER 3</h3>
				<p> We entered a mysterious lab. And, you would not believe it. A Kaminoan in a cloning tank. The Kamonian is all decayed, and withered. There were rumors that the Kaminoans were the cloners responsible for the Grand Army of the Republic. But, what did that Rex clone say about the chip? They were programmed? These clones were the ones who annihilated their Jedi Masters. There was a insignia in one of the other rooms. 501. I have to find out what that is. I need answers. Something is telling me there's no going back.</p>
