				<h3> CHAPTER 1</h3>
				<p> Right out of hyperspace. Left the previous star system in haste so that the Empire does not track me. What scares me, however, is that the Scrapper Guild has commissioned me to retrieve the computer from the debris of the Star Destroyer. They'll know that I have accessed the computer. And if the Guild know, the Empire knows if my suspicions are correct. Kamino. I have arrived. All I see are abandoned stations, drowned in the sea.  </p>

				<h3> CHAPTER 2</h3>
				<p> There's a station that is still up: surprisingly. This place looks like it has been shot from the sky. Meteors. Maybe a starfighter scrimmage. Something. R-12 has been slicing through the doors, which either work or don't. The Kaminoans are some tough engineers. We investigate the compound, and we stumble upon a lab.</p>

				<h3> CHAPTER 3</h3>
				<p> I felt a tug in me, telling me to go to Kamino. These computers aren't to be sold to the Scrapper Guild as the Empire has a hold of them. Perhaps the Empire is using them as a clean up crew to this whole conspiracy. Before I knew it, a blinker in my field of vision lit up. The Empire knows. I had R-12 wipe the computer, and we were on our way. To uncharted waters.</p>
